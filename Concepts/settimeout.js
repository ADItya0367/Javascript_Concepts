// set timeout in javascript is a function that calls a function or evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds.
// example
setTimeout(function(){
     console.log("hello");
 },1000);

 // In the above example, the setTimeout function is called with two arguments. The first argument is an anonymous function that prints "hello" to the console. The second argument is the number of milliseconds after which the function should be called. In this case, the function is called after 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
